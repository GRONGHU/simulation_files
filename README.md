Data accompanying "Wet Conformation of Prion-Like Domains: Mixture of Residues with Internal Water" by Guorong Hu and co-workers.

The manuscript investigated four intrinsically disordered proteins: FUS PLD wild type, FUS PLD G156E mutant,  TIA-1 PLD wild type and TIA-1 PLD P362L mutant .

Multiple independent simulations were performed for each protein, using Gromacs package. The Folder with the name of corresponding protein includes their initial conformation PDB files for all simulation trajectories.

The Folder "am99sb-disp.ff" includes the force field files for simulations. And the Folder "MDP files" includes the molecular dynamics parameters files for simulations.

The Folder "Calculating internal water" includes the codes to calculate internal water molecules within the proteins.
